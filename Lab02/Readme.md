In this lab the focus is on sequential circuits, The Exercise is to Design a module that performs three modes of operation.
**Trapezoidal rendering**: Given a trapezoid coordinates, find the points or pixels that line within the area covered by the geometric figure.
**Circle Line relationship**:Find out whether a line is (1) Tangent, (2) Intersecting, (3) non-intersecting to a circle given a point on the Circle and its center as well
as two points on the line.
**Area Computing**:  Given four points compute the area in between them to a certain accuracy.
