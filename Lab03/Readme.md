## AXI-SPI Data Bridge

In this lab, the task is to Write my own PATTERN and develop a pseudo SD card by referencing 
the provided design specifications and the SD card protocol. 

Both encrypted versions of correct and incorrect designs were provided to guide and assist in this process.

Additionally, a pseudoDRAM that not only simulates the behavior of actual DRAM but also verifies its specifications was provided.

Once the PATTERN and pseudo SD card were complete,I had to design a bridge module connecting the 
DRAM and the SD card.
