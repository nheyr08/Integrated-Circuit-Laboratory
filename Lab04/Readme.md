## Siamese Neural Network

The Siamese neural network is a type of neural network architecture designed for similarity
learning and feature extraction tasks. It is called "Siamese" because the network consists of two
identical subnetworks, known as twin networks, which share the same architecture and parameters.
These twin networks are used to process two different input samples.
The primary application of Siamese neural network is in tasks that involve determining
similarity or dissimilarity between two input samples. For example, Siamese networks are commonly
used in tasks like face recognition, signature verification, one-shot learning, and similarity-based
recommender systems. In this lab such a Neural Network is implemented using the specifications.
* In this lab, I used several IEEE floating point number IP from Designware.
